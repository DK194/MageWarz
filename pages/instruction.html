        <h2>About the game</h2>
        <p>MageWarz can be simply described as a variation of a popular "rock-paper-scissors" game but on steroids. In this game however, you can choose among the six elemental powers: fire, water, thunder, ice, wind and earth. Each of these elements has two strengths and two weaknesses. In addition to that, every element can clash against one, special power which results in both sides taking damage.</p>

        <h2>Game rules</h2>
        <p>Both you and the computer start off with 100 health points &#40;hp&#41;, and your goal is to reduce the computer's hp to zero. When that happens, the round ends and you're gaining a score which is equivalent to your remaining hp. Your game score is the sum of all rounds. When you lose the round against the computer, your score gets reduced to zero and you have to start over again. In case of draw you don’t lose your score, and you start the next round normally.</p>

        <h2>Battle rules</h2>
        <p>The element that’s strong against the other elemental power deals 40 hp damage to the opponent. When both you and the computer choose the same element, then the turn results in a draw and neither of the players is losing the remaining hp. However, when you and the computer player choose the special, elemental power that is neither weak or strong against each other, the turn results in a clash and you both lose 20 hp. The strengths and weaknesses of the elements are as follows:</p>

## Description

Mage Warz is a game that was built with HTML, CSS and "pure" JS. It can be described as a variation of a popular "rock-paper-scissors" game. In Mage Warz however, each player starts with 100hp, and the main goal is to reduce the opponent's health points to zero. In order to do that, both player and computer have six, different elemental powers at their disposal. Each of the elements has its own strengths and weaknesses. In addition to that, the elements can also "clash" against each other, which causes damage to the both players. You can read more about the game and its rules after clicking on ```How to play``` button.
